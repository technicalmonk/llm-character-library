# Introduction
Chat-based AI allows humans to interact with a collective unconscious - a profound step in our technological evolution. 

However, the issue with a collective unconscious is the problem of context. Though an intelligence system may be able to predictably produce an output that appears to be desirable, amazing outputs typically require accurate inputs - inputted in a manner in which comprehension, analysis, and processing can occur.  Therefore, context is the universe in which your prompt is generated. 

Now the problem isn't availability or access to knowledge but rather the proper subsegmentation and focusing of that knowledge towards a particular output - determining which facts need to be provided in order to get a desired output. Segmenting the collective unconscious towards a particular output or creating a bias requires prompt engineering and testing to create a desirable template.

It is for these reasons that the LLM Character Library exists.
